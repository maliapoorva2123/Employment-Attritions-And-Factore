**Employee Attrition Prediction Model**  

Developed an **Employee Attrition Prediction Model** using **Random Forest Classification**, leveraging a Kaggle dataset containing key employee attributes such as **age, job role, salary, work experience, department, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and attrition status**.  

- **Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key factors influencing employee attrition, detect patterns, and analyze feature correlations.  
- **Preprocessed the dataset** by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.  
- **Applied feature engineering** to enhance model accuracy and improve prediction performance.  
- **Implemented a Random Forest Classification model** to predict employee attrition with high precision.  
- **Evaluated model performance** using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score**.  

This project enhanced my expertise in **machine learning, EDA, feature engineering, and predictive modeling**, while deepening my understanding of **employee attrition factors and classification techniques**.
